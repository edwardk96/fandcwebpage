      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-emoji="👋">Hi, I’m Eddie.</li>
        <li data-emoji="📍">Originally from Yorkshire, I came to London 10 years ago.</li>
        <li data-emoji="💼">I’ve spent 7 years in Corporate jobs (🥱) and now feel ready for the next chapter / challenge.</li>
        <li data-emoji="🏃‍♂️">I’m slightly one-dimensional, as most of my free time is spent running, regularly competing in 100km ultra marathons.</li>
        <li data-emoji="🍰">Who doesn’t say this but… I also love a good book, baking, and a sunny Sunday afternoon pint.</li>

      <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li data-emoji="😀">Firstly, I genuinely just really enjoy it (admittedly there are also many hours I get stuck and hate it…).</li>
        <li data-emoji="🛠">I love the possibility of being able to build anything from a blank canvas – it feels like Lego, which I was obsessed with as a kid.</li>
        <li data-emoji="🗻">Secondly, having just given notice on my job, I plan to try and start my own business, having worked on, but not yet fully dedicated myself, to several projects in the last 12 months.</li>
        <li data-emoji="🧑‍💻">Whilst I’ve met and have experience working with engineers, I want to be able to understand, emphasise and contribute more. </li>

  <!-- Section 3: Why Founders & Coders? -->
  <section class="content">
    <div class="image-side" style="background-image: url('images/why-fac.jpg');"></div>
    <div class="text-side">
      <h2>Why Founders & Coders?</h2>
      <li data-emoji="📚">I started teaching myself a year ago, completing CS50 and working through the Odin Project, W3 Schools and FreeCodeCamp.</li>
      <li data-emoji="🧑‍🏫">I would really benefit from an in person programme to ask, learn and share best practises – the FAC workshop showed me the power of harnessing many diverse brains instead of one.</li>
      <li data-emoji="🧭	">Want to be part of and actively contribute to a community of self-starters and would be proud to be able to give back.</li>
      <li data-emoji="💡">AI has lowered the barriers to coding, but now more than ever it’s a no brainer to build solid foundations.</li>
      <li data-emoji="🎓">The founders component really appealed to me and the day a week structure would be most compatible with trying to start a business.</li>
